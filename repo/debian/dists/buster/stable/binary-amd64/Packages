Description: Snoopy Command Logger is a wrapper around execve() that captures all executed commands by all users and all processes and sends the data to syslog.
 Snoopy Command Logger is a shared library that interposes itself
 between dynamic executables and libc's execve() function.
 Once loaded, programs' calls to execve() are intercepted and logged.
 System administrators may find Snoopy Command Logger useful in tasks
 such as system diagnostics, tracking other administrators' actions
 as well as getting a good 'feel' of what's going on on their system
 (i.e. what CGI scripts are being launched by Apache).
